# LLM Cookbook Index

This is the high-level map of the cookbook.  
Start anywhere that looks useful.

---

## 1. Foundations

- [LLM mental models](./01-llm-mental-models.md)  
  How to think about what LLMs are (and aren’t).

- [Basic system prompt](./02_basic-system-prompt.md)  
  A simple, reusable system prompt you can adapt to most apps.

---

## 2. Prompting (coming soon)

Planned:

- Prompting mistakes I see everywhere
- Few-shot patterns (with copyable templates)
- Safety / disclaimers patterns

---

## 3. Retrieval & context (coming soon)

Planned:

- What “RAG” actually is in plain language
- How chunking and context windows really work
- When you probably don’t need a vector database

---

## 4. Tools & agents (coming soon)

Planned:

- Function calling mental model
- Designing good tools (arguments, names, descriptions)
- Simple planner-style “agent” patterns

---

## 5. Evaluation & debugging (coming soon)

Planned:

- What you should actually evaluate (beyond “vibes”)
- Tiny golden test set examples
- Avoiding silent regressions when you tweak prompts

---

This index will expand as I add more recipes.  
For now, check out the foundations, then come back later to see what’s new.
